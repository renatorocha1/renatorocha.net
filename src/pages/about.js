      <p>
        Full stack developer with over 4 years of experience. As a self-taught
        professional, I have commenced my career as a graphic designer until I
        discovered my passion for software developing, as it's a way of not only
        use my creativity, but also my logic focused mind to create new things
        and find solutions to improve the users experience. I have worked for
        different companies, having the opportunity to master new technologies
        providing me with a solid background.
